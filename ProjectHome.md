A Connect4 game, where an illusion of gravity is added.

NextGen Connect4 is actually the original Connect4 game where you
put men in rows and try to get 4 consecutive men of your color
before the other player.

In NextGen we have developed the idea of dropping a man in the grid.
We have established a central man that is the start of the game.
All other man should stick to this initial man but there is a catch:
you can try to add a man from all 4 sides!

In this way the central man is something like a planet with gravity
and all other men stick together to form a bigger and more twisted planet shape.

The board ration is chosen to be a square. The idea is to have a middle position
where the central man is going to be placed.

Initial size is 9x9 but there are other options : 11x11, 13x13 and 15x15.
(we have limited it to 15x15 because for now the playing ground is with fixed
size so that it is displayed in a right way on all monitor resolutions - 500x500).

Two players are playing the game - white and black(or blue/red).

The game ends and when there are no further legal moves - some empty bubbles are formed
- a planet with a gap :P
