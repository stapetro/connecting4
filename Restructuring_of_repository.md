# Strategy and migration #

A new code line has been added. It's for stable releases only, that should produce working program with most of the essential functionalities working.

It's under "/NextGenConnect4" folder - as the official name of the game has become.

The old /trunk/connect4 is preserved for a space for developers to use as workspace.
Only after reviews and acceptance by the project's owners  will the code from this "/trunk" code line be migrated to the main code line.
